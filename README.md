# Property Pulse
This is the project I created along with the [Next 14 From Scratch Course](https://www.traversymedia.com/nextjs-from-scratch) by Traversy Media. 
Since the project had some major errors when building the production version, in my version of Property Pulse those errors are fixed.


You can view this project at [miki-oggy.online](https://miki-oggy.online/) since I hosted it on a private VPS, or you can visit it via [Vercel](https://property-pulse-jade.vercel.app/). 
However, it is recommended to visit the app via [miki-oggy.online](https://miki-oggy.online/), as it is much, much faster compared to Vercel. 🙂
